    "Note that deque implements most of the list methods, and adds a few specific to its design, like popleft and rotate. But there is a hidden cost: removing items from the middle of a deque is not as fast. It is really optimized for appending and popping from the ends.\n",
    "The append and popleft operations are atomic, so deque is safe to use as a FIFO queue in multithreaded applications without the need for using locks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides deque, other Python standard library packages implement queues:\n",
    "* queue: This provides the synchronized (i.e., thread-safe) classes Queue, LifoQueue, and PriorityQueue. These are used for safe communication between threads. All three classes can be bounded by providing a maxsize argument greater than 0 to the constructor. However, they don’t discard items to make room as deque does. Instead, when the queue is full the insertion of a new item blocks—i.e., it waits until some other thread makes room by taking an item from the queue, which is useful to throttle the number of live threads\n",
    "* multiprocessing: Implements its own bounded Queue, very similar to queue.Queue but designed for interprocess communication. A specialized multiprocessing.JoinableQueue is also available for easier task management.\n",
    "* asyncio: Newly added to Python 3.4, asyncio provides Queue, LifoQueue, PriorityQueue, and JoinableQueue with APIs inspired by the classes contained in the queue and multiprocessing modules, but adapted for managing tasks in asynchronous programming.\n",
    "* heapq: In contrast to the previous three modules, heapq does not implement a queue class, but provides functions like heappush and heappop that let you use a mutable sequence as a heap queue or priority queue.\n",

    "Mastering the standard library sequence types is a prerequisite for writing concise, effective, and idiomatic Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python sequences are often categorized as mutable or immutable, but it is also useful to consider a different axis: flat sequences and container sequences. The former are more compact, faster, and easier to use, but are limited to storing atomic data such as numbers, characters, and bytes. Container sequences are more flexible, but may surprise you when they hold mutable objects, so you need to be careful to use them correctly with nested data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions and generator expressions are powerful notations to build and initialize sequences. If you are not yet comfortable with them, take the time to master their basic usage. It is not hard, and soon you will be hooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples in Python play two roles: as records with unnamed fields and as immutable lists. When a tuple is used as a record, tuple unpacking is the safest, most readable way of getting at the fields. The new * syntax makes tuple unpacking even better by making it easier to ignore some fields and to deal with optional fields. Named tuples are not so new, but deserve more attention: like tuples, they have very little overhead per instance, yet provide convenient access to the fields by name and a handy ._asdict() to export the record as an OrderedDict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence slicing is a favorite Python syntax feature, and it is even more powerful than many realize. Multidimensional slicing and ellipsis (...) notation, as used in NumPy, may also be supported by user-defined sequences. Assigning to slices is a very expressive way of editing mutable sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeated concatenation as in seq * n is convenient and, with care, can be used to initialize lists of lists containing immutable items. Augmented assignment with += and \\*= behaves differently for mutable and immutable sequences. In the latter case, these operators necessarily build new sequences. But if the target sequence is mutable, it is usually changed in place—but not always, depending on how the sequence is implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sort method and the sorted built-in function are easy to use and flexible, thanks to the key optional argument they accept, with a function to calculate the ordering criterion. By the way, key can also be used with the min and max built-in functions. To keep a sorted sequence in order, always insert items into it using bisect.insort; to search it efficiently, use bisect.bisect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond lists and tuples, the Python standard library provides array.array. Although NumPy and SciPy are not part of the standard library, if you do any kind of numerical processing on large sets of data, studying even a small part of these libraries can take you a long way.\n",
    "\n",
    "We closed by visiting the versatile and thread-safe collections.deque, comparing its API with that of list in Table 2-3 (see book) and mentioning other queue implementations in the standard library. "
