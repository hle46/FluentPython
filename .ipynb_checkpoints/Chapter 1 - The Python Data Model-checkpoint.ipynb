    "The first thing to know about special methods is that they care meant to be called by the Python interpreter, and not by you. You don't write *my_object.\\__len\\__()*. You write *len(my_object)* and, if *my_object* is an instance of a user-defined class, then Python calls the *\\__len\\__* instance method you implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "But for built-in types like *list*, *str*, *bytearray*, and so on, the interpreter takes a shortcut: the CPtyhon implementation of *len()* actually returns the value of the *ob_size* field in the *PyVarObject C* struct represents any variable-sized built-in object in memory. This is much faster than calling a method\n",
    "More often than not, the special method call is implicit. For example, the statement for i in x: actually causes the invocation of *iter(x)*, which in turn may call *x.\\__iter\\__()* if that is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, your code should not have many direct calls to special methods. Unless you are doing a lot of metaprogramming, you should be implementing special methods more often than invoking them explicitly. The only special method that is frequently called by user code directly is *\\__init\\__*, to invoke the initializer of the superclass in your own *\\__init\\__* implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to invoke a special method, it is usually better to call the related built-in function (e.g., len, iter, str, etc). These built-ins call the corresponding special method, but often provide other services and - for bultt-in types - are faster than method calls."
